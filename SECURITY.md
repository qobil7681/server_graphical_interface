# Reporting Security Issues

Please see https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact/ for how to report
an issue. Red Hat Product Security will also take reports for the version of
cockpit in Git, even if that is not a Red Hat Product.

We take security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to address
serious security-related problems that involve cockpit or its infrastructure.

Further details for the vulnerability process are linked from that page, like
the preference for embargo disclosure timelines of less than 45 days.

See also the documentation of [the threat model of
cockpit](docs/threat-model.md).
